# Twilio Playground

`poc-twilio` is a playground around **Twilio‚Äôs SMS sending/receiving capabilities**.

## Installation

With **Homebrew**, **Node** and **Yarn** installed:

```bash
make install
```

Then create a `.env` file based on `.env.sample`, and replacing the required values.

## Usage

### Sending SMS

```bash
make send_sms
```

### Receiving SMS

By running `server.js`, you create a server with 3 endpoints:

- `GET /`: a simple greeting health check;
- `POST /sms`: use this endpoint as Twilio Phone Number‚Äôs Messaging incoming webhook;
- `GET /latest`: returns the last received SMS content stored in memory.

Optionnaly, the `/sms` endpoint can forward received texts to a Slack channel (cf. `.env.sample` for configuration).

‚ö†Ô∏è For some reason, the webhook doesn‚Äôt seem to be get called when texts were sent from Twilio‚Äôs platform itself. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
